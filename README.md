**About:**

Froggex is an embedded systems project made using a microcontroller and a LED board. My idea came from the hit retro game called Frogger. In the early stages, the gameplay was based on the same idea. But, since a simple LED board is not capable of displaying fancy graphics and various colors like the original game, what I created in the early stages felt pretty empty and repetitive. So, instead of having just one level and making it progressively more difficult by increasing the speed of the enemies(traffic), I decided to make the game more entertaining by creating multiple unique levels. As in the original game, the player controls a green square and is able to move in four directions. Most levels contain walls and moving enemies. The goal is to avoid getting hit by the enemies and make it safely to the other side. The game contains 9 levels and a final boss level. The Microcontroller used for this project is BGM220-EK4314A from Silicon Labs and the LED board used was the Adafruit bicolor 8x8 led square matrix with I2C interface [ADA902]. Also, a set of four 12mm square tactical colored buttons are placed on the LED board. Lastly, a usb cord connecting the microcontroller to a power source is necessary.
